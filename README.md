# Hiring Agent

## Plug and play — best-fit resume

Clone this repo and open **this folder** as the project root in Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex, or Hermes. The resume skill loads from `.agents/skills/best-fit-resume/` (adapters in `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`).

Say **“build my best-fit resume.”** The agent asks for your profile once, saves it to `.resume-memory/profile.json`, takes your template and job description, checks the role online, runs three scoring passes, writes LaTeX, and saves the PDF.

```text
resume-build/src/          LaTeX source
resume-build/output/       compiled PDF
resume-archive/pdf/        saved copies
resume-tracker/resumes.xlsx   Name, Description, Yes/No, Date, Time, Role, Company, PDF, ATS
```

One-time setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

PDF compile needs TeX (`pdflatex` or `latexmk`: TeX Live or MiKTeX). Scoring with `score.py` needs the model config in `.env.example`. The skill still writes the `.tex` file and the tracker row if TeX or a model key is missing.

## Context and intent

This project got a lot of attention recently, and some of the discussion surfaced misconceptions worth addressing directly.

**What this is not:**
- Not an ATS (Applicant Tracking System)
- Not used to screen HackerRank's open roles
- Not a product available to HackerRank customers

**What it actually is:**

Every year HackerRank receives 50,000–60,000 intern applications. No human can read that many resumes well. This tool was built to *rank* them — helping decide which resumes to read first. Resumes scoring below the cutoff are filtered out, but the cutoff is intentionally set very low so only candidates at the very bottom of the distribution are removed. The vast majority pass through to human review, where the real decisions are made.

Since this was built, HackerRank has also shipped [AI Interviewer (Chakra)](https://www.hackerrank.com/products/ai-interviewer/) to automate the first round of interviews — so candidates are no longer assessed on their resume alone.

**On the default model:**

The repo ships with `gemma4:latest` as the default because it runs locally on most laptops without any cloud API key. Actual intern resumes at HackerRank are evaluated using a top-tier Gemini model. The repo ships with a demo config, not the production one.

| [HackerRank open sourced its ATS. My resume scored 90/100. Oh wait 74/100. No — 88/100. Actually 83/100.](https://danunparsed.com/p/hackerrank-open-source-ats) — *Dan Kinsky* | Deep statistical analysis of score variance across 100 runs of the same resume. Isolates which categories are stable (technical skills) vs. noisy (project quality judgments). Points to LLM non-determinism as the root cause. |

## Overview

Hiring Agent parses a resume PDF to Markdown, extracts sectioned JSON using a local or hosted LLM, augments the data with GitHub profile and repository signals, then produces an objective evaluation with category scores, evidence, bonus points, and deductions. You can run fully local with Ollama or use Google Gemini.

---

## Architecture

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Flow**

1. `pymupdf_rag.py` converts PDF pages to Markdown-like text.
2. `pdf.py` calls the LLM per section using Jinja templates under `prompts/templates`.
3. `github.py` fetches profile and repos, classifies projects, and asks the LLM to select the top 7.
4. `evaluator.py` runs a strict-scored evaluation with fairness constraints.
5. `score.py` orchestrates everything end to end and writes CSV when development mode is on.

</td>
<td>

**Key modules**

- `models.py`
  Pydantic schemas and LLM provider interfaces.

- `llm_utils.py`
  Provider initialization and response cleanup.

- `transform.py`
  Normalization from loose LLM JSON to JSON Resume style.

- `prompts/`
  All Jinja templates for extraction and scoring.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**

  The repository pins `.python-version` to 3.11.13.

- **One LLM backend** (either of them)

  - **Ollama** for local models
    Install from the [official site](https://ollama.com/), then run `ollama serve`.
  - **Google Gemini** if you have an API key, get it from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys).

### Quick setup with pip

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/interviewstreet/hiring-agent
$ cd hiring-agent

$ python -m venv .venv
# Linux or macOS
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Ollama Models

Pull the model you want to use. For example:

```bash
$ ollama pull gemma4:latest
```

If you want different results, you can pull other models such as:

```bash
# For higher system configuration
$ ollama pull gemma3:12b

# For lower system configuration
$ ollama pull gemma3:1b
```

---

## Configuration

Copy the template and set your environment variables.

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

**Environment variables**

| Variable         | Values                                      | Description                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL`  | for example `gemma4:latest` or `gemini-2.5-pro` | Model to use; must exist in `providers.json` — the provider is inferred from which provider lists it. Defaults to `default_model` in `providers.json`. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | string                                      | Required when using a Gemini model.                                   |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`   | optional                                    | Inherits from your shell environment, improves GitHub API rate limits. |

Provider mapping lives in `providers.json` — each provider declares its `base_url`, an optional API-key env var, and per-model parameters; `config.py` loads it and resolves the provider for a model. `config.py` also has a flag:

```python
# config.py
DEVELOPMENT_MODE = True  # enables caching and CSV export
```

You can leave it on during iteration. See the next section for details.

## How it works

<details>
<summary><b>1) PDF extraction</b></summary>

- `pymupdf_rag.py` and `pdf.py` read the PDF using PyMuPDF and convert pages to Markdown-like text.
- The `to_markdown` routine handles headings, links, tables, and basic formatting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2) Section parsing with templates</b></summary>

- `prompts/templates/*.jinja` define strict instructions for each section
  Basics, Work, Education, Skills, Projects, Awards.
- `pdf.PDFHandler` calls the LLM per section and assembles a `JSONResume` object (see `models.py`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3) GitHub enrichment</b></summary>

- `github.py` extracts a username from the resume profiles, fetches profile and repos, and classifies each project.
- It asks the LLM to select exactly 7 unique projects with a minimum author commit threshold, favoring meaningful contributions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4) Evaluation</b></summary>

- `evaluator.py` scores the resume against the **role** selected on the command line.
- Each role lives in `roles/<role_name>/` and defines its own scoring categories and weights in `role.json`, plus its own `criteria.jinja` and `system_message.jinja` prompts (encoding fairness and scoring rules).
- The shipped `software_engineering_intern` role scores `open_source`, `self_projects`, `production`, and `technical_skills`, plus bonus and deductions, with evidence for each. Other roles can define entirely different categories.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5) Output and CSV export</b></summary>

- `score.py` prints a readable summary to stdout.
- When `DEVELOPMENT_MODE=True` it creates or appends a per-role `resume_evaluations_<role>.csv` with key fields (columns follow the role's categories), and caches intermediate JSON under `cache/`.

</details>

---

## CLI usage

### End to end scoring

Provide a path to a resume PDF and the role to score against. `--role` is the
name of a directory under `roles/` and is **required**.

```bash
$ python score.py ./resume/sample.pdf --role software_engineering_intern
```

What happens:

1. If development mode is on, the PDF extraction result is cached to `cache/resumecache_<basename>.json`.
2. If a GitHub profile is found in the resume, repositories are fetched and cached to `cache/githubcache_<basename>.json`.
3. The evaluator scores the resume against the selected role, prints a report and, in development mode, appends a CSV row to `resume_evaluations_<role>.csv`.

### Roles

A role bundles its rubric in `roles/<role_name>/`:

```text
roles/software_engineering_intern/
├── role.json           # categories, weights (max), bonus_max, score bounds, position_title
├── criteria.jinja      # evaluation criteria prompt (receives {{ text_content }})
└── system_message.jinja
```

`role.json` drives the scoring schema, the printed report, the CSV columns, and
the score caps — so each role can score against its own categories and weights.

To add a role, scaffold one with basic template files and then edit them:

```bash
$ python score.py --init-role backend_engineer
# edit roles/backend_engineer/{role.json,criteria.jinja,system_message.jinja}
$ python score.py ./resume/sample.pdf --role backend_engineer
```

`--init-role` creates the role directory with placeholder categories and prompts
(it only scaffolds; it does not score a resume). You can also copy an existing
role directory instead.

## Provider details

### Ollama

- Set `DEFAULT_MODEL` to any pulled model listed in `providers.json`, for example `gemma4:latest`
- Requests go through `models.OpenAICompatibleProvider` against Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`http://localhost:11434/v1`)

### Gemini

- Set `DEFAULT_MODEL` to a Gemini model listed in `providers.json`, for example `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Provide `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- The same `models.OpenAICompatibleProvider` wrapper is used, pointed at Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Contributing

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines on filing issues, proposing changes, and submitting pull requests. Key principles include:

- Keep prompts declarative and provider-agnostic.
- Validate changes with a couple of real resumes under different providers.
- Add or adjust unit-free smoke tests that call each stage with minimal inputs.
